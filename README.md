Scripts for my upcoming game Wall

Only scripts are in this repository; the full project is a private repo because it contains spoilers for the full game and 3rd party art assets.

The meat and potatoes of the loop is in ScriptedEvents.  This collection of scripts makes up pretty much the entire player loop and drive narrative throughout the game.
